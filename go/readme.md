## INSTRUCTIONS [DOCKER]

1. Duplicate the **docker-compose.yml.example** file and rename the new file **docker-compose.yml** so it doesn't get included in Git.
2. Add the MongoDB Atlas URI string into the `MONGODB_URI` field of the **docker-compose.yml** file.
3. Build and deploy the Go application with `docker-compose up` using the optional `-d` flag if you'd like to deploy in detached mode.
